* lldb-mi flake

Flake for [[https://github.com/lldb-tools/lldb-mi][lldb-mi]]

** Use-case

My use-case is [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/][dap-mode]] with llvm.

** Notes

Hard-coded to llvm 15.x, because this is the current version that Rust is using. I'm uncertain if this is correct or good, but llvm-mi will not compile with the default llvm version set in nixpkgs today.
